      <p class="text"><span class="capital-letter">T</span>he desire to be respected by someone of 
      the opposite sex is something that runs deep within everyone, even 
      though most people don't take the time to find someone who truly
      respects them. It seems like people are just looking for someone to 
      show them the slightest amount of attention, settling for something 
      much less than respect. I am convinced one of the best ways to help 
      any relationship grow is by showing respect.</p>

      <p class="text">I have come to the conclusion that everyone long to be respected.
        What is respet? Respect is showing someone extra special attention,
        or high regard, based on a desire to show them how highly they
        are valued.
